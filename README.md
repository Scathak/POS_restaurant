**Point Of Sales - Restaurant**

A touchscreen-optimized Windows desktop application was developed for POS terminals in small restaurant environments. The solution is designed to be lightweight, secure, and with planned support for scanning QR and barcodes directly from video streams (via webcam or smartphone camera).

The application features an AI-generated illustrated menu and a responsive main window with a flexible layout that automatically adapts to various screen sizes, including tablets.

Key functionality of the main interface includes:
* Editable Visual layout of tables, cash registers, and refrigerators within the workspace.
* Real-time order management, displaying order flow and status tracking.
* Menu loaded from the database (with images).
* Flexible and diverse settings.
